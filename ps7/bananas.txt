Bananas are edible fruits, botanically berries. In some countries, bAnAnAs used for cooking are called plantains, distinguishing them from dessert bananaS. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless BANANAS come from two wild species of Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa X paradisiaca, depending on their genomic constitution.
